# solver-discovery

## Purpose & Scope

The `solver-discovery` crate is responsible for monitoring multiple sources to discover new cross-chain intents. It provides a unified interface for both on-chain blockchain event monitoring and off-chain API-based intent submission. This crate acts as the entry point for all intents into the solver system.

## Internal Architecture

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "solver-discovery Internal Structure"
        subgraph "Main Service"
            DiscoveryService[lib.rs<br/>Discovery Orchestration]
        end

        subgraph "On-Chain Discovery"
            OnChain7683[implementations/onchain/_7683.rs<br/>EIP-7683 Event Monitoring]
        end

        subgraph "Off-Chain Discovery"
            OffChain7683[implementations/offchain/_7683.rs<br/>REST API Endpoints]
        end

        subgraph "Discovery Sources (External)"
            BlockchainEvents[Blockchain Events<br/>Intent Submissions]
            RESTAPIs[REST API Calls<br/>Off-chain Intent Submission]
        end
    end

    BlockchainEvents --> OnChain7683
    RESTAPIs --> OffChain7683

    OnChain7683 --> DiscoveryService
    OffChain7683 --> DiscoveryService

    DiscoveryService --> CoreEngine[solver-core<br/>Event Bus]
```

## Discovery Flow

```mermaid

    participant Blockchain as Blockchain Network
    participant OnChain as On-Chain Discovery
    participant OffChain as Off-Chain Discovery
    participant Discovery as Discovery Service
    participant Core as Core Engine

    Note over Blockchain,Core: On-Chain Discovery Flow
    Blockchain->>OnChain: New Block with Intent Event
    OnChain->>OnChain: Parse Intent Data
    OnChain->>Discovery: IntentDiscovered Event
    Discovery->>Core: Validated Intent Event

    Note over Blockchain,Core: Off-Chain Discovery Flow
    Note right of OffChain: REST API Call
    OffChain->>OffChain: Receive Intent via API
    OffChain->>OffChain: Validate Intent Format
    OffChain->>Discovery: IntentDiscovered Event
    Discovery->>Core: Validated Intent Event
```

## Implementation Caveats

### ðŸ“¡ Off-Chain Discovery Considerations

- **API Security**: Must validate and authenticate incoming intent submissions
- **Data Validation**: Thorough validation of intent structure before processing
- **Duplicate Detection**: Same intent might be submitted via multiple channels

### âš¡ Performance and Scalability

- **Concurrent Monitoring**: Each network is monitored in parallel to avoid blocking
- **Event Processing**: High-frequency events require efficient batching and processing

## Configuration Examples

### Off-Chain and On-Chain discovery API Configuration example

```toml
[discovery]

[discovery.implementations.onchain_eip7683]
network_ids = [31337, 31338]

[discovery.implementations.offchain_eip7683]
api_host = "127.0.0.1"
api_port = 8081
network_ids = [31337]
```

## Extension Points

### Adding New Protocol Standards

1. Create new implementation modules under `implementations/onchain/` or `implementations/offchain/`
2. Implement the `DiscoverySource` trait
3. Add protocol-specific event parsing and validation
4. Register with the main discovery service

The solver-discovery crate provides flexible, reliable intent discovery across multiple sources while maintaining clear separation between on-chain and off-chain discovery mechanisms.
