# solver-settlement

## Purpose & Scope

The `solver-settlement` crate handles post-execution settlement verification, claim processing, and dispute resolution for cross-chain intents. It validates fill transactions, manages dispute periods, coordinates oracle verification for cross-chain proofs, and generates claim transactions when ready.

## Implementation Caveats

### ‚è∞ Timing Complexity

- **Dispute Periods**: Different protocols have varying dispute/challenge periods
- **Block Finality**: Must wait for sufficient finality before extracting proofs
- **Claim Deadlines**: Claims may have expiration deadlines that must be met

## Configuration Examples

### Settlement Timing Configuration

```toml
[settlement.timing]
dispute_period_seconds = 3600  # 1 hour
min_confirmation_depth = 12
oracle_timeout_seconds = 300
claim_deadline_hours = 24

[settlement.costs]
max_claim_gas_price_gwei = 50
min_profit_threshold_usd = 10.0
gas_optimization = true
```

### Protocol-Specific Settings

```toml
[settlement.protocols.eip7683]
enabled = true
dispute_period_seconds = 3600
require_oracle_verification = true

[settlement.protocols.eip7683.contracts]
ethereum = "0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890"
polygon = "0x0987654321098765432109876543210987654321"

[settlement.oracle]
type = "chainlink"
endpoint = "https://api.chain.link/v1/settlements"
timeout_seconds = 300
retry_attempts = 3
```

## Extension Points

### Custom Settlement Strategies

1. Implement alternative settlement logic in `implementations/`
2. Add protocol-specific proof extraction and validation
3. Integrate with different oracle systems
4. Handle protocol-specific dispute mechanisms

### Oracle Integration

1. Implement oracle-specific proof submission interfaces
2. Add support for multiple oracle systems
3. Handle oracle-specific proof formats and verification
4. Implement fallback mechanisms for oracle failures

The solver-settlement crate provides comprehensive post-execution settlement capabilities while maintaining flexibility for different protocols, oracle systems, and dispute resolution mechanisms.
